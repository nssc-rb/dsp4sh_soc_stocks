# Defining Dynamic Soil Property and Soil Health Reference Conditions for Soil Survey

This repo contains the R code and most data needed to calculate total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks from the Dynamic Soil Properties for Soil Health v.1.0 database, and generate tables and figures from *Dynarski, K.A.; Wills, S.A.; Carter, T.; Adeleke, E.; Kandanool, D.; and Veum, K.S. Defining Dynamic Soil Property and Soil Health Reference Conditions for Soil Survey. Soil Advances (2025). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilad.2025.100061* 

To run the code, you will also need to download the DSP4SH v.1.0 database (https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/25122323.v1) and save in the /data_raw folder. 

* To clean data, calculate SOC stocks, and generate data files for downstream analysis, run code/01_main.R
* To run analyses and generate tables and figures displayed in the manuscript, run code/dsp4sh_ref_states_figs.Rmd
* To view report with tables and figures from manuscript, open code/dsp4sh_ref_states_figs.md
